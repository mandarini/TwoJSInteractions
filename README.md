# TwoJSInteractions
Simple implementation of TwoJS library with mouse and key interactions

## Dependencies
* It uses the [Two.js](https://two.js.org/) library, a "two-dimensional drawing api". So, you need to provide the [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonobr1/two.js/master/build/two.js) to the library. [Here](https://github.com/jonobr1/two.js) is the github page.

* It also uses the [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) library, which can be linked from [here](https://code.jquery.com/).

## Description
This is a simple showcase (with less features possible) of mouse and keyboard interactions in Two.js.
A ball is created and then moved around and changed size and color according to user mouse movements and key presses.
